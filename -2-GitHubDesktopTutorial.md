# GitHub Desktop Tutorial

Please make sure you've completed part 1 before you complete the next step.

First, make sure that you have installed GitHub Desktop from self service, or from desktop.github.com if you are so able.

Once you open the program, find the repository that we are working on: Project-Nibbler/Nibbler-Internal-Git-Tutorial

Now you're on the main page, you can switch to the branch you would like to work on. Do not work directly on main!
