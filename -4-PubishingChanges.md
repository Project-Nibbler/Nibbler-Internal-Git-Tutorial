#Publishing your Changes.

Now that you have made all of the changes that you'd like in VScode (we will be doing this when editing Marlin, for example).

Once saved, please open GitHub desktop, and then you'll see all of the changes that you've made. Now we are going to commit and push our changes to the branch that we made, so that they can be approved.

In the bottom left, type in a summary and then a description into the commit. The commit is when you want to essentially save your work on a greater scale. It is saving it to the master log of changes.

Once commited, you'll see a big blue button saying push origin. This will make your changes be pushed up to github.com so that everybody can see them. This is important to do each time otherwise nobody can see your changes.

Now, let's say that you're completely done with your changes that you created the pull request for in the first place, press the create a pull request button:

A pull request is a compilation of commits that is usally solving a problem or adding a new feature. Whereas you'd like to commit whenever you make a few small changes, even if something isn't tested or totally finished yet you ONLY create a pull request when your problem is totally solved and ready for others to look at in more detail.

This will open a browser window where you want to explain all of the changes and goals of the branch that you made:

Fill out the details on the right for who you'd like to review your code (me / @maevebaksa for now, I guess) under reviewers and also what the reason behind your pull request is, under bug or enhancement etc:

Create the pull request and you are done!

Once this is all done, someone will review the code, and then merge it into the main branch, so that everybody can have the newest code with all of the changes that we will be making it.

Now, let's learn how to edit the Marlin Firmware that we will be making! Move onto the 5th documentation.
