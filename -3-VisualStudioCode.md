Please make sure that you have completed the previous steps before continuing on to this.

Now, let's get into our text editor in order to make changes to the code!

Please make sure that you have installed a new version of *Visual Studio Code*. Download this from Microsoft's website, or from Self Service.

When in *GitHub Desktop*, select the *Open in Visual Studio Code* option:
